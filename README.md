# Task 2
This task is partially completed (first part), no solution coded for question about optimum number of people for party, but here is some intuition:

Intuition is in that approach that we have to invite friends with less connections with other people firstly (degree of a vertex is --> min), and than only invite people with bigger and bigger degree of a the vertex. So, degree of each vertex should be precomputed. Such approach allows to invite most people, which are not familar with each other.
(degree of a vertex - number of edges on the node)

In the folder "Task 2" tree files are presented:
1) *module.py* - module within classes with methods (simple graph, as well as random graph creation);
2) *task2_solution* - Jupiter notebook with description of solution (*module.py* duplicated inside)
3) Html version of *task2_solution* to preserve all pictures


# Task 3
In the folder 2 and 3, content for Task 2 and Task 3 is presented accordingly
